challenge: "My challenge was to further understand Ruby on Rails and API integration"
text: "Web app to organize your stocks on a dashboard"
process: "I explored accesible APIs and found the IEX Cloud API for financial data which I integrated into the Rails application. For my next project, I would like to explore caching the data in order to improve the speed of the application."
result: "A web application built on Ruby on Rails to organize the stocks you follow on one dashboard. I created a search functionality for real-time stock prices and financial data and a dashboard that shows the stocks the user follows along with highlights that display stocks that have dropped or raised significantly in value."
