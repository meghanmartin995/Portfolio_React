Role: I created this website for a client who needed a complete redesign of their vacation rental website. My services included UX design, web development, SEO and graphic design.

Tools: HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Netlify

Credits: I created this website on my own for a client.

Lessons Learned:

www.lamalpensatina.com

The website is an informational website highlighting the beauty of a farmhouse in Tuscany, Italy. It also includes essential logistics and downloads. I created custom graphic design to give the website a unique and warm feel. I also designed a 15 page welcome packet to send to guests upon booking with all details about the house and area.
