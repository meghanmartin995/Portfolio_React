challenge: "How could I redesign a website for a Tuscan farmhouse to showcase its beauty for future guests?"
text: "Informational website for tuscan farmhouse"
process: "This website was inspired by the St. Regus Venice website. Below are the Figma mockups of both mobile and desktop that were approved by the client before development."
result: "The website is an informational website highlighting the beauty of a farmhouse in Tuscany, Italy. It also includes essential logistics and downloads. I created custom graphic design to give the website a unique and warm feel. I also designed a 15 page welcome packet to send to guests upon booking with all details about the house and area.
