title: "Explorations: Machine Learning"
doc:  "Code"
challenge: "I wanted to further explores the possibilities with machine learning and Python"
process: "I first tested the Tensorflow API by building my own dataset of vegetable photos to train the classifier to classify different vegetables on the terminal. I then discovered the Tensorflow Javascript library and tested Tensorflow and the Mobilenet dataset on the browser against pictures of my dogs using transfer learning."
result: "Wrote a Python script that uses pre-trained facial recognition networks to recognize my boyfriend in photos to freak him out. It can recognize each person's face in the photo as a face encoding and compare them to the sample photo I provided."
text: "Facial recognition + Tensorflow.js"

role: "Code: Built a tiny web app that uses the web cam to recognize images using the Mobilenet dataset"
tools: "Python, Deep learning, DLIB API, OpenCV and facial_recognition model"
credits: "Tensorflow.js, face_recognition module"
