title: "Explorations: APIs"
doc:  "Code"
text: "Image search with Unsplash API"
challenge: "My challenge was to further explore APIs, AJAX and Javascript through building projects"
process: "In order to further practice working with APIs and Javascript, throughout the SuperHi course I also created a restaurant website that connects with Contentful CMS so a client can easily update their website's content, a bitcoin tracker where the user can choice the currency and a random quote generator."
result: "The image searcher integrates with Unsplash's API to display images tailored to search queries via JSON data."
