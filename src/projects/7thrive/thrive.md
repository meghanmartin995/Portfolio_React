Role: UX Design, Product Design and Strategy for ArcelorMittal Research & Development

Tools: UX research: deep interviews, stakeholders & territory maps, benchmarking, live prototyping, UX design: Sketch, Adobe Suite, data visualization

Credits: I worked on this project on a team of four with Miguel Rodriguez, Tanisha O'neill, Madeline Honingform in collaboration with ArcelorMittal and NH Hotel Group

Lessons Learned: How to conduct unconventional user research because users will rarely ever tell you what they really need
