challenge: "How could ArcelorMittal and strategic European partners best test, collect data and showcase their most radical innovations?"
text: "B2B sustainable technology platform"
process: "The task was to design a service that would gather data on how users experience their products within a modular and sustainable space. After dozens of partner and user interviews, we built a business network and sustainable technology sharing platform in order to boost sustainable innovation and product development. Alongside the platform, wee designed a device that would unobtrusively collect guest data and interaction with products, compiled into a database accessable to all partners which works within a modular space to showcase their products. The devise is pre-programmed with guest preferences, objectives and profile, swaps contacts on tap, monitors heart rate and skin temperature and the amount of natural resources the wearer uses in the space."
