challenge: "How can ArcelorMittal and their strategic European partners best test, collect data and showcase their most radical innovations?"
text: "B2B sustainable technology platform"
process: "We went through a four month process of user research and stakeholder interviews. We conducted 30 deep interviews, in addition to receiving over 100 survey responses. Our research included field research, benchmarking and data analysis. After co-creating a variety solutions, we tested them on users in order to come to our final concept of a B2B sustainability platform and data monitoring device. We presented our final concept to Arcelor Mittal's European board of directors in Madrid, Spain."
result: "The task was to design a service that would gather data on how users experience their products within a modular and sustainable space. After dozens of partner and user interviews, we built a business network and sustainable technology sharing platform in order to boost sustainable innovation and product development. Alongside the platform, we designed a device that would unobtrusively collect guest data and interaction with products, compiled into a database accessable to all partners which works within a modular space to showcase their products. The devise is pre-programmed with guest preferences, objectives and profile, swaps contacts on tap, monitors heart rate and skin temperature and the amount of natural resources the wearer uses in the space."
