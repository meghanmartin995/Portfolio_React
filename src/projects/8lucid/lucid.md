title: "Lucid"
doc:  "Design"
challenge: "How can we democratize the conversation about the future of technology?"
result: "Lucid is a set of 250 conversation cards that prompt thinking differently and creating optimal future scenarios for humanity. The deck is divided into eight sections: thinking differently, future scenarios, what it means to be human, creating & innovating, alternate realities, human consciousness, shaping tomorrow, the big questions, and rethink. Rethink is designed to to challenge your thinking & initial answers, see alternative perspectives and your own biases.
"
process: "The conversation cards are designed to provoke thinking differently about the world and its norms & creating the future that we want. I think we have to decide on an individual, community then cultural level what a good life is, what it means to be human, we want for ourselves and what type of future we want for the planet. The more we bring this into our conversations the more it impacts our decisions collectively. It’s not just a few people but it’s all of us shaping the world. The world shaped us, and then we shape the world right back. The future won’t be about doing the same thing over and over again. Anything that can be automated will be. We have a choice to be fearful of this or to embrace it and let it give the chance to discover a richer path of life fulfillment. I think that path should be of conversation and knowledge sharing.It's not about what will happen, it's about what we should do."
