title: "Lucid"
doc:  "Design"
challenge: "How can we democratize the conversation about the future of technology?"
result: "Lucid is a set of 250 conversation cards that prompt thinking differently and creating optimal future scenarios for humanity. The deck is divided into eight sections: thinking differently, future scenarios, what it means to be human, creating & innovating, alternate realities, human consciousness, shaping tomorrow, the big questions, and rethink. I created Lucid because I think we have to decide on an individual, community then cultural level what a good life is, what it means to be human, we want for ourselves and what type of future we want for the planet. The more we bring this into our conversations the more it impacts our decisions collectively. It’s not just a few people but it’s all of us shaping the world.
"
process: "The conversation cards are designed to provoke thinking differently about the world and its norms & creating the future that we want. Throughout their creation, I tested the cards on users to see what types of questions provoke open discussion. During this process, I decided to include the last category, rethink  to challenge the player's thinking & initial answers, see alternative perspectives and your own biases."
